SM3 Alert RunBook – Avaya Communication Manager (ACM) - LSP active

Alert Name: LSP active

Alert Expression: acm_survivable_processor_active{type="acm"} * on (fqdn,number) group_left(name,network_region) (acm_survivable_processor_info) == 1

Category: Avaya Enterprise (Convergence)

Description: Local Survivable Processor is showing as active in main CM.

Possible Cause(s):

Network issue / communications failure between main CM and media gateways / DSP resources.
Impact: 

It should mean that local call processing should still work via the LSP but call routing could be affected for those users and they may not be able to make / receive all types of calls. Users on the main CM may not be able to contact users on the LSP.

Next Steps:

Log onto the main CM and run the command: 

list survivable-processor

Check to see if the 'Act' column still has a 'y' in it - if it is then the LSP is still active and has media resources registered to it.
If the LSP is in a media gateway run the command list media-gateway to see if the gateway is registered. If it is not then this indicates a communication failure between CM and the MG.

Run ping / traceroute commands from the CM to the LSP to see what the state of connectivity is.

If the LSP is in a media gateway, run ping / traceroute commands from the CM to the MG to see what the state of connectivity is.

If there is no connectivity then check if there are any ongoing network issues (may need to check with customer).

Can also review the system logs in CM for IP events.


Log into the LSP and run the command - status media-gateway - this will show if any media gateways are registered to the LSP. The command 'list registered' on the LSP will also show which phones the LSP has registered to it.
