SM3 Alert RunBook – Avaya Communication Manager (ACM) - Media Gateway Link Status

Alert Name: Media Gateway Link Status

Alert Expression: (acm_media_gateway_link_status{type="acm",state!="up"} * on (fqdn,number) group_left(name,network_region) (acm_media_gateway_info)) == 1

Category: Avaya Enterprise (Convergence)

Description: The H.248 link between the media gateway and Communication Manager has dropped.

Possible Cause(s):

Communication / network issue between CM and the media gateway.
System has gone into survivable mode.
Fault with the media gateway.
Impact: 

System could be in survivable mode meaning that the survivable server(s) could be controlling some or all of the call processing.

DSP capacity could be reduced.

Announcements could be affected.

Depending on the cards installed in the gateway (e.g. analogue cards) then certain call types / functionality may be unavailable.

 

 

 

Next Steps:

Log onto CM and run the command -  list media-gateway - check to see if the 'Reg' column says 'y' or 'n' - if this is no then the gateway is not registered to CM.

Run the command - status media-gateway - check the output of the link ('Lk') column - this should be 'up' if the link is active.

Run the command - list survivable and see if any survivable servers are showing as 'Registered' = no / Active = yes - if so then the system is in ESS / LSP mode.

See if the media gateway can be pinged from the CM server.

See is the media gateway can be logged onto and run the commands 'show faults' to see if any faults are active.
